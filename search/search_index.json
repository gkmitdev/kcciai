Depending on where your data is stored we have a connector for it. If your data is in Excel then Excel is fine, hopefully with your data in rows and the column headers on the first row since it makes it easier to load data that way. If your data is in text files then the same as Excel, data in rows (comma separated for example) and column header at the top. As an example of data structure, below are examples of a good and bad data structure:</p> <p>Pivoted data (Not Recommened)</p> Name Age Country Alice 25 USA Bob 30 Canada Charlie 22 UK"},{"location":"page3/#data-flow","title":"Data Flow","text":"<p>Data Flow is a module that processes data from one or more input tables and outputs it to one or multiple tables.
